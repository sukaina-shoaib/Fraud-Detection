# Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes customer, vehicle, and policy-related attributes to identify patterns that may indicate fraudulent behavior. The objective is to help insurance companies reduce financial losses by automatically identifying suspicious claims.

## Dataset Description

The project uses an insurance fraud detection dataset where each record represents an insurance claim.

### Target Variable

* **FraudFound_P**

  * `1` indicates a fraudulent claim
  * `0` indicates a non-fraudulent claim

### Data Includes

* Customer demographic details
* Vehicle information
* Insurance policy attributes
* Accident and claim-related features
